## 👋 About me

<img align="right" src="/assets/images/profile.png" alt="Profile picture." width="120" height="120">

Hi! My name is Marek, and I'm a Product Designer with a passion for user testing and design systems.

I usually like to know my tools well. Whether it's Figma, Axure, Google Docs, Miro, Jira or Slack, I will know their limitations and some cool features that will help me work without any obstacles. I enjoy sharing my knowledge with colleagues, trying to be involved in design team trainings, company conferences, or just chatting around coffee about the latest findings from user tests.

Speaking of user testing, I love working with users. And I can't stress enough how valuable their input is. Finding their struggles and verifying their hypotheses is a crucial part of my day-to-day work.

I'm curious by nature and I like to know how things work. Since I work closely with developers, I'm constantly improving my knowledge about frontend technologies. I've also been spending some time learning a bit more about QA work and processes.

## ✏️ UX/UI Design
### Selected projects

**Bonito** - online bookstore and more `ecommerce`

[Website](https://bonito.pl/) | [App](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/bonito/id1511513709)
> This was a very fulfilling project since I had a rare opportunity to be involved in the rebranding process. Apart from that, tackling both the website and mobile app was a great challenge that benefited both platforms in the end.

---

**BeActiveTV** - fitness app `fitness` `vod`

[App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beactivetv-pl/id1549817661?platform=iphone)
> This was an interesting project, which was, at its core, just a VOD platform. Aligning with multiple teams was a challenging task, but it was also great to see all the different adaptations (website, TV, mobile devices, smartwatches) come together.

**Esotiq** - women lingerie brand `ecommerce` `fashion`

[Website](https://esotiq.com/pl/pl) | [App](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/esotiq-bielizna-online/id1641269253?l=pl)
> Again, tackling both the website and mobile app is a cool thing. It really highlights the differences between both of them. Especially the website needs to be very flexible when it comes to adapting it to multiple languages, currencies, and possible sub-domains.
